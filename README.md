# YelpReviewPredictionSystem
Our aim is to develop a recommendation system which help users by recommending restaurant based on the rating of it predicted using reviews given to it by previous customers. The principal data source that we chose to work with as the project is to analyze and predictions of review given in Yelp Dataset for year 2013. Using this dataset, we extract customer, restaurant profiles and rating given for suggesting recommendations. In particular we have implemented Naïve Bayes algorithm to actualize this system. This is basically Naïve Bayes text classification. This report is an attempt to document and discuss the entire implementation details and result analysis. I start the discussion with an introduction to the problem statement, the motivation behind this project and detailed explanation of the work and results. Further, we have listed some of the possible future work and the challenges I came across while actualizing the project.
